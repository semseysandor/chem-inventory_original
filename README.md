## ChemInventory

This is a chemical inventory suitable for a medium-sized company.
A very similar system is actually used in the industry.

Like any inventory, this system is designed to answer two questions:
1. **WHAT** we have
2. **WHERE** it is

Chemicals are structured in categories/subcategories. There are *compound*s,
a compound can have *batch*es and a batch can have many *pack*s.
Locationwise you can design *laboratories* (rooms), inside laboratories different
*storages* (like cabinets, cupboards, fridges, etc.) and inside storages some *sub-
storages* (e.g. shelves of a cupboard). Anyway, you can use any logic, nevertheless
there is a 3-tier location system.

Compound, batch and pack management is through the web interface.
Locations & manufacturers are stored in the database as well as user right levels,
so you can manipulate them with a database management software or plain SQL.

Barcodes are assigned to each pack, so you can use labels for identification
in the lab. (barcode printing is not implemented yet in this application)

Uploading the CoA and MSDS documents are possible for each batch.

Adding and editing batches and packs is only allowed for admins.
Users can add/edit compounds and upload documents, whereas guests only can view
and search the database.
